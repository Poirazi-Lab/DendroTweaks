**DendroTweaks** is a Python toolbox designed for creating and validating single-cell biophysical models with active dendrites. 

It is available both as a standalone Python package and a web-based application.

## Learn More

- **Standalone Library**: Explore the [official documentation](https://dendrotweaks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for detailed tutorials and API reference.
- **Web Application**: Access the GUI online via our platform at [dendrotweaks.dendrites.gr](https://dendrotweaks.dendrites.gr).
- **Quick Overview**: Check out our [e-poster](https://doi.org/10.57736/abba-7149), including a video demonstration, presented at the FENS Forum 2024 in Vienna.
